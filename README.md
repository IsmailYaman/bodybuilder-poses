# Bodybuilder poses
This is a small application that recognizes the bodybuilding pose that you are doing. Only 4 poses are recognized for now. (Relaxed pose, front double biceps, front lat spread, most muscular) 

This project was part of the machine learning course from year 3 of programming at Creative Media & Game Technologies.
